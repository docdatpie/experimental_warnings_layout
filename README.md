# experimental_warnings_layout
Minimal layout for warning-decorators in python library

After a discussion on warning users (of [PyVO library](https://github.com/astropy/pyvo)) 
about experimental features in the library, where the use of decorators would be the way
to do it, remained doing it because...why not.

The code is simple: a couple of decorators/functions to warn the user
of some experimentall/deprecated code.
There is a particular _if_ to handle modules, if a whole module happen
to be "experimental"; it makes sense to me to warn when the module is loaded.

The `app.py` module has a workflow of some app using `api`.
